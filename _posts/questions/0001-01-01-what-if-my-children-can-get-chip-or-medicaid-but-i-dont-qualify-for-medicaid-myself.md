You may be able to get coverage through the Marketplace and [get lower cosgts on your monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) or [out-of-pocket costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs). Starting October 1, 2013, you can fill out the Marketplace application. We'll tell you which programs you and your family qualify for, including private insurance and any cost savings. You can apply even if some family members already have health coverage.
